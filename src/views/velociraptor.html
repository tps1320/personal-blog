                        <li> The name Velociraptor means ‘swift seizer'</li>
                        <li> Velociraptor lived in the late Cretaceous Period (around 73 million years ago)</li>
                        <li> The Velociraptor played a large role in the Jurassic Park movies but was often shown inaccurately. Rather than being a larger, human sized dinosaur, the Velociraptor was around the size of a Turkey. It is also believed to have had feathers that were not shown in the movie portrayal</li>
                        <li> A fully grown Velociraptor could grow up to 2m (6.6ft) in length, 0.5m (1.6ft) in height at the hip and weigh up to 15kg (33lb)</li>
                        <li> The Velociraptor is thought to have killed its prey with sickle shaped claws on its rear feet</li>
                        <li> The first known Velociraptor fossil was found in the Mongolian Gobi Desert in 1922</li>
                        <li> One of the most famous dinosaur fossils ever found features a Velociraptor in the middle of battle with a Protoceratops</li>
                        <li> The NBA basketball team based in Toronto, Canada, are known as the Toronto Raptors. Both their team name and logo are based on the popular dinosaur</li>
