                        The name <b><q>Spinosaurus</q></b> refers to the huge spines that grew from its back.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Spinosaurus lived around <u>100 million years ago</u> in what is now North Africa</li>
                        <li>The name Spinosaurus means <q>spine lizard</q></li>
                        <li>Fossils of the Spinosaurus were first found in <b>Egypt around 1910</b></li>
                        <li>The Spinosaurus was larger than the Tyrannosaurus Rex and may have been the <i>largest carnivorous</i> (meat eating) dinosaur ever</li>
                        <li>Studies estimate that it was around <i>15 metres (49 feet) in length and weighed anywhere between 7 to 20 tons</i></li>
                        <li>The Spinosaurus featured distinctive spines which grew over 1.5 metres (5 feet) long</li>
                        <li>The Spinosaurus had a long, thin skull</li>
                        <li>While the Spinosaurus usually walked on two legs, studies suggest that it may have occasionally crouched on all four</li>
                        <li>Spinosaurus featured in the popular movie Jurassic Park 3</li>
                    </ul>
