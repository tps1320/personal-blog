                        <b><q>Allosaurus</q></b> was a large dinosaur that lived around <u>150 million years ago</u>. It was a <i>carnivore with big, sharp teeth</i> and there is even evidence to suggest that it attacked the much heavier Stegosaurus.

                    <ul>
                        <li> Allosaurus lived around 150 million years ago in the <b>late Jurassic Period</b></li>
                        <li> The name Allosaurus means <q><u>different lizard</u></q></li>
                        <li> Allosaurus was first described by <b>Othniel Marsh in 1877</b> and became one of the first well known dinosaurs</li>
                        <li> Most Allosaurus fossils have been found in the <i>Morrison Formation</i>, a distinctive band of sedimentary rock found in the western United States</li>
                        <li> Allosaurus had a large skull and walked on two legs</li>
                        <li> Its body and head were balanced by a long and heavy tail</li>
                        <li> Like the Tyrannosaurs rex, the Allosaurus had short arms. It had three fingers that were each tipped with sharp, curved claws</li>
                        <li> Research suggests that the average length of an Allosaurus was around <i>8.5 metres (28 feet)</i> and that it weighed around <i>2.3 tons</i></li>
